Translib is for Transformer Library. Translib is an Erlang application that
contains some parse transformers to extend or modify the semantic of Erlang.

For the moment, Translib contains 6 modules:

    * gen_trans: a behaviour module for implementing a parse transformer of
      Erlang code.

    * lambda_expr: a transformer that simplifies the partial application and the
      composistion of functions in Erlang.

    * recfun: a transformer that makes possible to easily write recursive
      anonymous function.

    * clone_module: a transformer that builds modules by cloning the content of
      another one.

    * multiparser: a "meta" transformer that can perform several
      parse_transformations.

    * transhell: a "clone" of the Erlang shell that transforms expressions
      before evaluation calling a multiparser transformer.
